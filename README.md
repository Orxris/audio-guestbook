# Audio Guestbook

## Introduction
This is a 'barebones' build, in that a lot of other features you find in other tutorials have been stripped away in favour of creating a 'simple' guestbook.
Due to poor planning, the code used in my existing phone was lost. The initial commits to main and alpha represent the closest representation as a lot of the code has remained the same only refactored in to separate functions.

## Road Map
1. Add support for status LEDs (Power, Recording etc.)
2. Error codes in LED or Audio patterns (Through headset).
3. Add support for screen and button input.
4. Add WiFi and/or Bluetooth support for write to Web Storage instead of/in addition to the micro SD card.
