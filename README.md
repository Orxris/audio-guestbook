# Audio Guestbook

## Introduction
This is a 'barebones' build, in that a lot of other features you find in other tutorials have been stripped away in favour of creating a 'simple' guestbook.
Due to poor planning, the code used in my existing phone was lost. The initial commits to main and alpha represent the closest representation as a lot of the code has remained the same only refactored in to separate functions.

## Performance
I'd be keen to speak with anyone who has experience with testing the performance of code in hardware projects such as this. I have a feeling that there is a lot than can be done to make this code more efficient, I just don't know if it's warrented.

## Road Map
1. Add support for status LEDs (Power, Recording etc.)
2. Error codes in LED or Audio patterns (Through headset).
3. Add support for screen and button input.
4. Add WiFi and/or Bluetooth support for write to Web Storage instead of/in addition to the micro SD card.
